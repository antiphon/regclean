# R-package `{regclean}`

Cleaning regular (Strauss) point patterns from Poisson noise. 

The package implements the methods presented and discussed in the the paper Rajala, Redenbach, Särkkä, Sormani "Variational Bayes approach for classification of points in superpositions of point processes" [^pap].

At the moment the code is near carbon copy of the code written in 2015 and probably does not work properly due to dependency issues. If you have interest in this package, please contact the author and the issues will be fixed.

The package requires the custom package `{rstrauss}`, found here: https://github.com/antiphon/rstrauss .
